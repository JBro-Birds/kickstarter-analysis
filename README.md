# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
The purpose of this analysis on Kickstarter data is to uncover trends to crowdfunding data to determine whether there are specific factors that make a project's campaign successful.  More specifically, Loiuse has asked for help to determine if her crowdfunding campaign goal for her play "Fever" has the potential to be successful based on the analysis.

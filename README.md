# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview of Project
Analyze crowdfunding data to determine trends to help Lousie with her crowdfunding campaign goal.

### Purpose of the Project
The purpose of this analysis on Kickstarter data is to uncover trends to crowdfunding data to determine whether there are specific factors that make a project's campaign successful.  More specifically, Loiuse has asked for help to determine if her crowdfunding campaign goal for her play "Fever", which has a $10,000 budget, has the potential to be successful based on the analysis.

## Recommendation
The "theater" category as well as the "play" subcategory does have a favorable volume of successful crowdfunding campaigns, but there are two determining factors impacting the success rate.  First, supported by the data set and descriptive statistics the greater the campaign goal $value the greater the failure rate.  Median goal $values up to $5,000 have a greater success rate, but when goals are set greater than $5,000 the success rate becomes less likely.  In addition, the campaign start date is a determinant of the success rate.  Campaings that kick off during the months of May, June, and July have a higher success rate vs. other months.
